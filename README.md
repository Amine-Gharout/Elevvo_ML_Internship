## 🚀 Usage

### Running Notebooks

1. **Start Jupyter:**
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

2. **Navigate to desired project folder**

3. **Open and run the notebook:**
   - Traffic Sign Recognition: `traffic_sign_recognition.ipynb`
   - Music Genre Classification: `music_genre_classification.ipynb`
   - Customer Segmentation: `customer_segmentation.ipynb`

### Memory Considerations

**For Traffic Sign Recognition on low RAM devices:**
- The notebook is optimized for 4-8 GB RAM
- Uses batch size of 16
- Implements chunked data loading
- Includes aggressive garbage collection

If you have more RAM (16+ GB), you can increase:
- `BATCH_SIZE` from 16 to 32 or 64
- `chunk_size` in loading functions
- Model capacity (more filters, larger dense layers)
